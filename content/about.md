Hi there! My name's Pavlos and I'm a [Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) based in Munich, Germany. I am particularly interested in building software and expanding my knowledge around the reliability of services and their infrastructure.

I enjoy [contributing](https://github.com/dastergon) to open source software. I have created a few open source [SRE projects](/projects) such as the [awesome-sre](https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-sre) and [Wheel of Misfortune](https://dastergon.gr/wheel-of-misfortune), to assist teams and individuals get on board the SRE culture. Finally, I was the technical reviewer of the ["Real World SRE"](http://a.co/d/34UsUVU) book from Packt Publishing, where I offered suggestions regarding the content of the book.

You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dastergon) or shoot me an [email](mailto:dastergon@gmail.com).
